Dr. Julian Geiger is a postdoctoral researcher / Research Software Engineer at the Materials Software and Data group led
by Dr. Giovanni Pizzi at PSI. He studied chemistry at the Friedrich Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany,
showing an early interest in atomistic modelling. After an Erasmus stay at the University of Cambridge and the
completion of his Master thesis at the company BASF in Germany, he did his PhD at the Catalan Institute of Chemical
Research (ICIQ) in Tarragona, Spain. During his doctoral studies, he investigated electron transfer dynamics in
ceria-based single-atom catalysts (SACs) using Density Functional Theory (DFT). In his current position, he is involved
in the development of the AiiDA workflow engine as well as contributing to augmentative tools such as the
AiiDA-WorkGraph.
